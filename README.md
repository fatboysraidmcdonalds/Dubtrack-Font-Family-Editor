# Dubtrack-Font-Family-Editor
Dubtrack changed some fonts, which I (and some other people in chat) personally don't like. I made these bookmarks so that we don't have to keep using Chrome Web Console to change the font-families.

# Font-Family: "proxima-nova"
This is the font Dubtrack used before the update, use this if you want the old Dubtrack font look

# Font-Family: "initial"
This is a rather plain font, but people like this font because it makes a capital "i" and a lowercase "L" distinguishable
